# An App Template

I've made an app template with premake because I wanted it to help me set up future projects easier. 

 * To use it, simply press "**Use this template**".
 * Create a repository
 * Clone your repository on your machine
 * Rename *TemplateApp* to your liking
 * Run *setup.bat* in /scripts
 
> Done!
